# Learning Erlang

## This Repository

I'm learning Erlang using _Programming Erlang_ (Second Edition) written by Joe
Armstrong. The chapter folders (`ch01`, `ch02`, â€¦) contain my solutions to
(most) exercises.

Furthermore, there are some additional examples:

- [`soccer-table`](soccer-table/): Compute and display the league table from a
  given file of soccer results.
- [`huffman`](huffman/): Compress and decompress text using Huffman coding
  trees.

## First Steps

Installation (Arch Linux):

    # pacman -S erlang-nox

REPL:

    $ erl

Manual pages (e.g. about lists):

    $ erl -man lists
